 Session 1: Text Classification Workflow using Python
 1. Introduction to Text Classification
   - Overview of text classification and its real-world applications (e.g., spam filtering, sentiment analysis).
   - Introduction to key Python libraries (Pandas for data handling, NLTK for text processing, Scikit-learn for classification).

 2. Workflow 1: Text Preprocessing using NLTK and Pandas
   - Objective: Clean and preprocess text data for text classification.
   - Steps:
     - Import text data (e.g., customer reviews or emails) using Pandas.
     - Tokenize the text using NLTK, remove stopwords, and apply lemmatization.
     - Transform text data into numerical features using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
     - Hands-on Example: Preprocess a dataset of articles, converting raw text into numerical features ready for classification.

 3. Workflow 2: Text Classification using Scikit-learn
   - Duration: 50 minutes  
   - Objective: Build and evaluate a text classification model.
   - Steps:
     - Use Scikit-learn to build a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
     - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
     - Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
     - Hands-on Example: Classify articles into multi-class [Politics, Sports, Technology, Entertainment] sentiment using a Naive Bayes classifier, Logistic Regression and SVM.
